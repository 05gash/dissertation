[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Through the affordability of display panels and cheap wide-an

. To meet this demand, efficient rendering software and practices will need to 
be adopted.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Graphics rendering pipelines take good advantage of available
 GPU power. But the constraints of realistic, immersive virtual reality present
 a huge challenge to engineers. They must output a high resolution, wide field 
of view, antialiased image, with a response to stimulus time under 20ms.[] 
 []

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 As this technology progresses and matures, it will become inc
reasingly important to provide low-latency response times. Resolutions will nee
d to increase to around 8K*8K, but to achieve this our graphics processing hard
ware and software will have to evolve too.[]

Overfull \hbox (305.51682pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Aliasing in graphics refers to spatial and temporal artefacts
 present in a rendered image. They are the result of sampling a higher frequenc
y signal component at a lower freqency.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (271.51633pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Antialising is the process of removing such artefacts, but th
is has to be done efficiently or we will sacrifice frame drops and potential mo
tion sickness for the end-user.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (275.76639pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 There are a multitude of antialiasing approaches, though most

 []


Overfull \hbox (3.76248pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 There are a multitude of antialising approaches, one of the m
ost common is Supersampled Anti-alising (SSAA).[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (1538.03452pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Then, before presenting, we downsample this image by taking f
or each pixel in the presented image, a linear combination of its closest neigh
bors in the higher resolution image. In the figure below, we sample 4 times per
 pixel in the presented image, run each sample through the fragment shader and 
then use these to form the resulting image. The formula for for determining the
 final colour of the pixel is the simple mean average for each colour (Red, Gre
en and Blue):[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (1644.28604pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Another common approach, that is built into the OpenGL API, i
s Multisampled Anti-aliasing (MSAA). As before, we sample the scene at a higher
 resolution than we intend to present it. If one of our subsamples is covered b
y a triangle being rendered, we must run a fragment shader on the whole sample,
 but the result of that fragment shader is applied to all subsamples. This mean
s that we only need to run the fragment shader the same number of times as we w
ould have in the single sampled image.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (454.26895pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 MSAA provides a significant speedup over SSAA and is widely e
mployed in practice, but only removes spatial artefacts at polygon edges. SSAA 
can remove artefacts within polygons, an example of which we'll see later.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 A typical virtual Reality Headmounted Display (HMD) is compri
sed of 2 main components: The screen - to which our rendered image is presented
 and a wide-angle lens - to project the displayed image into the eye. The lens 
allows for the user to focus on a screen that is normally too close for the eye
 to focus on by itself.[] 
 []

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Side effects of the lens used in the Oculus Rift DK2 are chro
matic abberation, pincushion distortion, and astigmatism.\\[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (309.76688pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Chromatic abberation refers to the separation of colour due t
o the different refractive indexes for different wavelengths of light. A Virtua
l Reality API should correct for this.\\[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (1372.28214pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 483--483
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Pincushion distortion refers to the stretching of the image n
ear the egdes. We can apply the inverse of pincushion distortion, barrel disort
ion, to our image to reverse the effects of pincushion distortion. The barrel d
istortion results in a varying number of texels per pixel in our final image, a
 property we'll investigate and explore in the second extension. Again a Virtua
l Reality API should apply barrel distortion for you.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Lens astigmatism is a property of the lenses used in most con
sumer HMDs. Because of the astigmatism, the image presented to the user is shar
p in the center but becomes progressivelly blurrier as you look towards the edg
es.  It can be corrected for by adding more lenses to the HMD, but this ends up
 being too expensive and bulky for consumer versions.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Unfortunately, modern consumer headsets suffer from astigmati
sm because of a single lens between the viewer and the display. We can't remove
 these distortions without (another) anastigmatic lens, however we do currently
 give equal preference to image quality across the whole of the display even wh
en the edges of the image become distorted.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Novel anti-aliasing techniques, such as subpixel-reconstructi

 creating an entirely rasterized solution that retains image quality while allo

 which will allow me to easily create separate reusable demos to show off certa
