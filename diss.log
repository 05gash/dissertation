[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Graphics rendering pipelines take good advantage of available

 a huge challenge to engineers. They must output a high resolution, wide field

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Then, before presenting, this image is downsampled by taking 
for each pixel in the presented image, a linear combination of its closest neig
hbors in the higher resolution image. In the figure below, to calculate the fin
al pixels colour, 4 samples per pixel are computed, each run through some downs
ampling filter, each providing a quarter of the color for the final, presented 
image. The formula for for determining the final colour of the pixel is the sim

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Another common approach, that is built into the OpenGL API, i
s Multisampled Anti-aliasing (MSAA). As before, the scene is sampled at a highe
r resolution than we intend to present it, forming a coverage mask for each pix
el. If any of the samples in this coverage mask are covered by a triangle, we n
eed to run a fragment shader for this pixel. The result of the fragment shader 
is applied to all relevant subsamples in the coverage mask. We therefore don't 
have to run a fragment shader for every subsample in the pixel, only those that
 are covered by multiple triangles.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 MSAA provides a significant speedup over SSAA and is widely e

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 A typical virtual Reality Headmounted Display (HMD) is compri
sed of 2 main components: The screen - to which our rendered image is presented
 and a wide-angle lens - to project the displayed image into the eye. The lens 
allows for the user to focus on a screen that is normally too close for the eye
 to focus on by itself.[]

pplied to reverse the effects of pincushion distortion. The barrel distortion t
hat the Oculus SDK applies results in a varying number of texels per pixel in o

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Lens astigmatism is a property of the lenses used in most con

p in the center but becomes progressivelly blurrier as you look towards the edg
es.  It can be corrected for by adding more lenses to the HMD, but this ends up
 being too expensive and bulky for consumer versions.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 While a user study performes provides a robust assesment of i
mage quality across different approaches, Computational metrics for objective i
mage quality assesment can be essential. The performance of the system determin
es how quickly the image resonds to stimulus which can help reduce simulation s
ickness in the user. Given that implementations of graphics APIs differ dramati
cally, along with hardware implementations, measuring a framerate directly on a
 particlar machine cannot be the best indicator of performance as a whole. Thou
gh the render time per frame of different approaches are given, it should be un
derstood that performance can vary dramatically across different hardware vendo
rs, graphics APIs and their implementations, and rendering programs. Given this
, a range of other information is given to best represent the antialiasing appr
oaches and given some more meaningful insight into their execution. Information
 such as: triangle count, fragment and vertex shader invocations, API calls, GP
U usage, CPU usage, along with some interpretation of this in a platform indepe

the same shader code roughly 1 million times more. This can be attributed to th

ultisampling is forced to make double the number of API calls sequentially. It 
could also be down to the GPU being better able schedule fragment shaders and e

 in the edges of the image. The number of fragments that we shade is reduced by
 half, compared to the standard, non-supersampled image size that Oculus recomm
ends. However, twice as many vertices need to be processed. Given that the bott
leneck in most consumer applications are in the fragment shader stage, and that
 we generally need to process significantly more fragments that vertices, we sh
