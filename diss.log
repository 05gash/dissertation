[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Then, before presenting, this image is downsampled by taking 
for each pixel in the presented image, a linear combination of its closest neig
hbors in the higher resolution image. In the figure below, to calculate the fin
al pixels colour, 4 samples per pixel are computed, each run through some downs
ampling filter, each providing a quarter of the color for the final, presented 
image. The formula for for determining the final colour of the pixel is the sim

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Another common approach, that is built into the OpenGL API, i
s Multisampled Anti-aliasing (MSAA). As before, the scene is sampled at a highe
r resolution than we intend to present it, forming a coverage mask for each pix
el. If any of the samples in this coverage mask are covered by a triangle, we n
eed to run a fragment shader for this pixel. The result of the fragment shader 
is applied to all relevant subsamples in the coverage mask. We therefore don't 
have to run a fragment shader for every subsample in the pixel, only those that
 are covered by multiple triangles.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 MSAA provides a significant speedup over SSAA and is widely e

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 A typical virtual Reality Headmounted Display (HMD) is compri
sed of 2 main components: The screen - to which our rendered image is presented
 and a wide-angle lens - to project the displayed image into the eye. The lens 
allows for the user to focus on a screen that is normally too close for the eye
 to focus on by itself.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Pincushion distortion refers to the stretching of the image n
ear the egdes. The inverse of pincushion distortion, barrel disortion, can be a
pplied to reverse the effects of pincushion distortion. The barrel distortion t
hat the Oculus SDK applies results in a varying number of texels per pixel in o

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Lens astigmatism is a property of the lenses used in most con
sumer HMDs. Because of the astigmatism, the image presented to the user is shar
p in the center but becomes progressivelly blurrier as you look towards the edg
es.  It can be corrected for by adding more lenses to the HMD, but this ends up
 being too expensive and bulky for consumer versions.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 This property can be exploited by antialiasing only where the
 image is sharpest, in the center. Graphical artefacts at the edges should be b
lurred enough to be unnoticable. It is this principle that we'll develop the fo

 to it. The latter approach is adopted by the Oculus SDK 5.0.1. Another approac
h can be built into the rendering pipeline in the vertex shader, it removes the
 need for post-processing, but additionally requires the use of tesselation.[]
