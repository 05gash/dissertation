\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview of the files}

This document consists of the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{makefile} --- The makefile for the dissertation and
                         Project Proposal
\item \texttt{diss.tex} --- The dissertation
\item \texttt{proposal.tex}  --- The project proposal 
\item \texttt{figs} -- A directory containing diagrams and pictures
\item \texttt{refs.bib} --- The bibliography database
\end{itemize}

\section{Building the document}

This document was produced using \LaTeXe which is based upon
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport86}.  To build the document you first need to
generate \texttt{diss.aux} which, amongst other things, contains the
references used.  This if done by executing the command:

\texttt{pdflatex diss}

\noindent
Then the bibliography can be generated from \texttt{refs.bib} using:

\texttt{bibtex diss}

\noindent
Finally, to ensure all the page numbering is correct run \texttt{pdflatex}
on \texttt{diss.tex} until the \texttt{.aux} files do not change.  This
usually takes 2 more runs.

\subsection{The OpenGL pipeline}

The OpenGL pipeline is comprised of several stages. As graphics programmers we generally only concern ourselves with two of the programmable stages: The fragment shader and the vertex shader.

From the vertex shaders perspective, it is provided with an individual vertex, and the data that might be associated with it (3d Cartesian coordinates, Vertex Colour, UV Texture coordinates) These are then processed arbitrarily by the vertex shader. And passed onto vertex Post-Processing stage, which we have little or no control over as programmers.

From the fragment shaders perspective, we are provided implicitly with our fragments position within the viewport (Including depth information) and any other data that was passed on by the vertex shader (Texture coordinates). We can then perform lighting calculations, texture lookups in this stage.

\begin{description}

\item\texttt{make} \\
 Display help information.

\item\texttt{make proposal.pdf} \\
 Format the proposal document as a PDF.

\item\texttt{make view-proposal} \\
 Run \texttt{make proposal.pdf} and then display it with a Linux PDF viewer
 (preferably ``okular'', if that is not available fall back to ``evince'').

\item\texttt{make diss.pdf} \\
 Format the dissertation document as a PDF.

\item\texttt{make count} \\
Display an estimate of the word count.

\item\texttt{make all} \\
Construct \texttt{proposal.pdf} and \texttt{diss.pdf}.

\item\texttt{make pub} \\ Make \texttt{diss.pdf}
and place it in my \texttt{public\_html} directory.

\item\texttt{make clean} \\ Delete all intermediate files except the
source files and the resulting PDFs. All these deleted files can
be reconstructed by typing \texttt{make all}.

\end{description}


\section{Anti-Aliasing techniques}

Aliasing occurs when we misrepresent a signal frequency as we sample it. 
To ameliorate artefacts such as these in a graphics pipeline we can employ one of various techniques:

\subsection{Multisample Anti-aliasing}

The default technique employed by OpenGL, this technique samples a number of times only along polygon edges and downsamples the fragment before it is passed to the fragment shader. In most scenarious this approach is adequate, but this technique fails where artefacts are visible inside of polygons boundaries.

\subsection{Supersample Anti-aliasing}

Being the simplest approach, we take multiple samples for each pixel onscreen, and downsample before presenting the image.

This approach h results in the best image, and can ameliorate aliasing inside of polygon boundaries.
\texttt{wc diss.tex}

\noindent
Alternatively, try something like:

\verb/detex diss.tex | tr -cd '0-9A-Z a-z\n' | wc -w/

\section{Verbatim text}

Verbatim text can be included using \verb|\begin{verbatim}| and
\verb|\end{verbatim}|. I normally use a slightly smaller font and
often squeeze the lines a little closer together, as in:

{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.8}\small
\begin{verbatim}
GET "libhdr"
 
GLOBAL { count:200; all  }
 
LET try(ld, row, rd) BE TEST row=all
                        THEN count := count + 1
                        ELSE { LET poss = all & ~(ld | row | rd)
                               UNTIL poss=0 DO
                               { LET p = poss & -poss
                                 poss := poss - p
                                 try(ld+p << 1, row+p, rd+p >> 1)
                               }
                             }
LET start() = VALOF
{ all := 1
  FOR i = 1 TO 12 DO
  { count := 0
    try(0, 0, 0)
    writef("Number of solutions to %i2-queens is %i5*n", i, count)
    all := 2*all + 1
  }
  RESULTIS 0
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Tables}

\begin{samepage}
Here is a simple example\footnote{A footnote} of a table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|r}
Left      & Centred & Right \\
Justified &         & Justified \\[3mm]
%\hline\\%[-2mm]
First     & A       & XXX \\
Second    & AA      & XX  \\
Last      & AAA     & X   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
There is another example table in the proforma.
\end{samepage}

\section{Simple diagrams}

Simple diagrams can be written directly in \LaTeX.  For example, see
figure~\ref{latexpic1} on page~\pageref{latexpic1} and see
figure~\ref{latexpic2} on page~\pageref{latexpic2}.

\begin{figure}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}

\put(0,40){\framebox(50,10){CCC}}
\put(0,20){\framebox(50,10){DDD}}
\put(0,00){\framebox(50,10){EEE}}

\put(75,80){\framebox(50,10){XXX}}
\put(75,60){\framebox(50,10){YYY}}
\put(75,40){\framebox(50,10){ZZZ}}

\put(25,80){\vector(0,-1){10}}

\put(100,50){\vector(0,1){10}}

\put(50,65){\vector(1,0){25}}
\put(75,65){\vector(-1,0){25}}
\end{picture}
\end{center}
\caption{A picture composed of boxes and vectors.}
\label{latexpic1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\end{picture}

\end{center}
\caption{A diagram composed of circles, lines and boxes.}
\label{latexpic2}
\end{figure}



\section{Adding more complicated graphics}

The use of \LaTeX\ format can be tedious and it is often better to use
encapsulated postscript (EPS) or PDF to represent complicated graphics.
Figure~\ref{epsfig} and~\ref{xfig} on page \pageref{xfig} are
examples. The second figure was drawn using \texttt{xfig} and exported in
{\tt.eps} format. This is my recommended way of drawing all diagrams.


\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centerline{\includegraphics{figs/cuarms.pdf}}
\caption{Example figure using encapsulated postscript}
\label{epsfig}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\vspace{4in}
\caption{Example figure where a picture can be pasted in}
\label{pastedfig}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centerline{\includegraphics{figs/diagram.pdf}}
\caption{Example diagram drawn using \texttt{xfig}}
\label{xfig}
\end{figure}


\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Optimisation}
While the approach outlined can give a unnoticably similar image to the user, it will have been for nothing if we can't perform it as quickly or slower than the default MSAA method. 

We can do a few things to speed things up:
	Decrease resolution at the edges,
	Downgrade lighting and texture calculations at the edges,
	Perform an early depth pass to exploit hardware specific early depth optimisations,
	
By far the most obvious performance improvement we can make is to run fragment shaders on fragments we know will be visible,

We render our scene twice, yet we run fragment shader code into an area of the viewport that will be overwritten my a multisampled area.

Our fragment shaders shouldn't run in these areas, so we should fail fast in areas that will be overwritten.

This snippet can be used to quickly determine if our fragment is in an area that will be overwritten.

code

code

Then we only perform the useful bulk of the fragment shader code exactly the same number of times as when we weren't multisampling at all.

Alternatively we could run our render pipeline for the multisampled central area first. Then, since our depth buffer will be populated, force early depth tests on our next render pass so that fragment shaders only run on the outer edges of the image.
Because this approach doesn't run the boundary check above, we should expect better performance from this, but this early depth test optimisation is implementation specific - we can't guarantee that the approach will work on all platforms. So we don't use this optimisation.
